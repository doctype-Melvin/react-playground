# Learning and playing with React
Components, state, props, render, functional and class components

## Elements
Elements describe what will be seen on the screen. 
To render any given element, React needs a root DOM Element appenda given element. 



## Components
My whole understanding of React.js is based on the image of a box full of Lego pieces.
The fact that you can put together pieces of any shape represents the component part.
If I were to put together a stack of Lego pieces to create a unit, that would be 
the equivalent to a component. The individual Lego pieces are HTML elements. They 
make up my component. 
Said in another way: The component's main method is the fact that there are bumps and
indentations on every piece. That's the main functionality - you could piece together
any Lego pieces you find.
`Heads Up:` I'm willing to reassess this model the more I get to know React.

## Dynamic data output
Use `{ }` to output variables, strings, calculations or returned values.
Ternary expressions are allowed in `{ }`.

## Props
Props are passed to components to configure them.
The `properties` or `props` is declared in the React Component. 
Hence there is no need to declare or define it anywhere.
Prop types: used to validate props. It's good practice to declare propTypes in the component's file.
